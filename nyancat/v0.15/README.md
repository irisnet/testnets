## v0.15.0-rc3

### Upgrade Tasks

#### Steps

Ref: <https://github.com/irisnet/betanet/blob/master/upgrade/v0.15.0.md>

1. `nyancat-4` startup time: `2019-08-05 10:00:00 (UTC) ~ 2019-08-06 01:00:00 (UTC)`

2. Upgrade proposal time: `2019-08-07 13:00:00 (UTC)`, we'll have 24 hours to vote. If you are not a validator in `nyancat-4`, please create one before the upgrade proposal, so as not to affect the acquisition of upgrade task points.

3. Version switching time: `2019-08-09 13:00:00 (UTC)`, which means we'll have 24 hours to upgrade our nodes to the new version after the upgrade proposal passed.

For every task, only the top 40 validators who completes can get rewards (the upgrade task is based on the voting list of the upgrade proposal, if a valid voter doesn't complete upgrade in time, the reward will be extended to the next completed validator)

| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| 8 | Upgrade to v0.15.0-rc3 | Rehearse the mainnet upgrade from v0.14.* to v0.15.0 | Validators who voted for the `SoftwareUpgrade` proposal, and had a valid Precommit in the first 300 blocks after the version switch | 200 |

## v0.15.0-rc1

In the `v0.15` version, we introduced a new module: [Asset Management](https://github.com/irisnet/irishub/blob/develop/docs/features/asset.md). IRISHub allows individuals and companies to create and distribute their own tokens for any scenario they can imagine.

Since `v0.15.0-rc1` is not a stable version, we will launch a new testnet `nyancat-3` to test and perform tasks, during which we may upgrade one or more times until the final `v0.15.0` is released.

The upgrade of mainnet from `0.14` to `v0.15` is a major event, because this will be the first attempt among BPoS blockchains to perform on-chain software upgrade without stopping the network!  So after `v0.15.0` is released, we will propose a new testnet upgrade task, restart `v0.14.3` and upgrade to `v0.15.0` through on-chain governance, and rehearse the entire process of upgrading the mainnet.
