**NOTE:**

IBC transfer can be done very easily through the clients, for example, you can send tokens from `Bifrost-2` to other testnets:

```bash
iris tx ibc-transfer transfer transfer <src-channel> <receiver> <amount> \
    --absolute-timeouts \
    --packet-timeout-timestamp 0 \
    --from <sender> \
    --chain-id bifrost-2
```

 For more details, please refer to the client docs:

```bash
iris tx ibc-transfer transfer --help
```
