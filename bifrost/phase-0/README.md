# Bifrost-0

As the current version is still in rapid development, incentived and rewarded tasks will not be released in this phase. This phase is intended for:

- Testing wallets, exchanges and block explorers against the legacy Amino REST interface
- Giving node operators and validators an opportunity to test their integrations against a work in progress version

## How to Join

It'll be the same as joining [IRIS Hub Mainnet](https://bifrost.irisnet.org/docs/get-started/mainnet.html), except that:

- [version](https://github.com/irisnet/irishub/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha)
